# AI-ChatBot
This project features an interactive AI-powered chatbot built using Ollama LLM and developed with Python. The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries effectively. It is deployed on a web interface using Streamlit, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience. It makes use of LLM models within Ollama like mistral to ensure the best accuracy and speed of the model. The project focuses on enhancing conversational capabilities, automating responses, and optimizing interactions. Through this implementation, I gained hands-on experience in LLM integration, web deployment, and NLP-based chatbot development, improving my skills in model optimization, problem-solving, and user experience design.
